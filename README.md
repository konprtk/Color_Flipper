- Fun and educational for beginners.

## Getting Started

These instructions will help you get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/konprtk/Color-Flipper.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in your code editor.

3. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser to run the Color Flipper.

## How It Works

The Color Flipper generates random colors by combining hexadecimal values. JavaScript is used to handle the color generation, and the UI is created using HTML and CSS. The main logic is in the `app.js` file.

```javascript
// JavaScript code for generating random colors
// ...

// Event listener for the "click me" button
btn.addEventListener('click', function(){
    // Generate a random color
    // ...

    // Update the UI with the color
    color.textContent = hexColor;
    document.body.style.backgroundColor = hexColor;
});

// ...
```

Feel free to explore the code and make modifications as you wish.
